		 /*What is the difference between parameter and arguments?
		 	Parameters are what the method receives (in method's header)
		 	Arguments are what is sent to a method (in method's call statement)


		   What do you need to remember about parameters?
		   	 They can be named anything
		   	 Must include the data type for every parameter even if they are the
		   	 	same type.
		     They must correspond exactly to the arguments


		   What type of method's do we know?
		   	 Value-return Method
		   	 Void Method


		   What is the difference between them?
		   	 void - do not return anything
		   	 value-returning: they return some type of variable that is defined
		   	 	in the header

		   	 void: call statement is just the name of the method/argument
		   	 value-returning: call statements can be in print line, set equal
		   	 	to another variable, in conditional statements, equation/expression
		   	 	*It is recommended you store the result in a variable because
		   	 	it is easier to read and maintain


		   What are overloading methods?
		   	Two or more methods that have the same name different parameters
		   		(different amount or different types)

		   	You cannot tell by the return type


		   What is recursive method?
		   	A method that calls itself (Done in the last chapter)


		   What else do you need to remember about methods?
		   		- To use overloading method make sure your focusing on your
		   		  arguments/parameter list

		   		- If you alter an Object (we saw with Arrays) in a method it is changed
		   		  for the entire program.

		   		- Any variable declared in the method are local variables so those primitive
		   		  data type changes are only changed in the method.

		   		- Names of the parameters can be the same, but usually different because
		   		  methods are generic.

		   		- After a method is completed it goes back to exactly where it was called
		   		  from and then completes that section of code */
